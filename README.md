# ConfigFiles

## Description
These are config files used in my system for customizable things like neovim/ohmyzsh, etc. Can be used as reference/examples/for your own system.

## Requirements

### NVIM
neovim, a nerdfont in .local/share/fonts (can be in any subfolder there. in my case font is "hack")
